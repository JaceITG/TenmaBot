ok so the intro up until how did this happen, as well as the first few lines of the nothing section are fine.
even though you might think the intro would be problematic, if anything would be, but it's really not.

but let's face it, the nothing section is really long, and if we can shorten this section then we may get the entire video off on a briefer foot

but first

sleep 
pick up the Wacom 

etc

see where that leaves us.

it won't really be necessary to draw anything necessarily,


but we gotta figure out if the existential part works all the way through


and see how bad a chain reaction it imposes on the rest of the video


and overall i wouldn't mind really, if it gets shorter , and stays strong.

loving blender although very dense.
then had realization that interface may be garbage
the above all reason is the impossibility of exporting things without this insane charade of manually renaming them without prompt and without warning of overwrite.
I don't know how you could function like this

also scary is no prompt to save, etc
things just overwrite everywhere and all the basic file controls taken for granted on any program are not there. to a dangerous degree.
it would be like being forced to count your steps manually on the way to the grocery store 

so after reading a couple of reviews i started looking for other progs

wings3d was a dream at first but whoops no anim.
now on aoi. found a 2009 version , had to really dig.
love that it feels almost as simple as superpaint or something. but really there are prob not enough controls and i fear it really is insanely prim.
but hey, if u think about it, it's at least worth checking to see if a globe would work

it is important to remember that shortly before I ran into the export file name overwrite crisis in blender, I had just arrived at a bold decision to basically not fully do territories in blender-- and this was after laboring for hours to get the key out and transparency etx.... then I realized... the glow/cross fade that happens so often with my territories....

behind the scenes:   making a longer video that doesn't fit on vine, while still doing 7 vines a week.  

step 1:  




(jingle) making a longer video

behind the scenes


step 1     tell  vine   now you have time.











I'm gonna make a long video  I don't care 






News Flash
we're gonna make a (sung) Looooong video
(spoken) get ready to go (sung) 'Behind the Scenes' (spoken) as we make that long video





second video      quick bong and colorful 1 screen expanding title ,  behind the scenes, making a long video

step 1:     you have to tell vine you're doing a long video and you're gonna give behind the scenes updates on vine every day.  i don't care how long this takes i (sung) gotta make a long video



vid 3
(quick blip)behind the scenes update

ok now we have to decide what kind of video we're doing.

are we doing a
    song
    science (video)
    history (video)
    some kind of music lesson
    a longer behind the scenes video about another video
    autobiographical
FIND OUT NEXT, WHEN I FIND OUT!!




previously on 'Making a long video while still making short videos'
     i still don't know what kind of video to make, and i want to do them all.  (rhythmic rapped pickup to jingle)   so I got to use  (sung) Randomization !
super catchy but super chromatically slippery and chordally dense

show going to the site
but also wild bright flashing colors

and quickly in the same vid, show the list (below) and the entering of the number and immediately like an alarm sort of thing on the one that is selected






for those of you just joining us:  we're making a video longer than 6 and a half seconds 

song
research
music lesson
behind the scenes
autobiographical











this is a good idea but FACE IT

if u pick song, or, fuck it, whatever u pick 
you're not really gonna be able to do behind the scenes on the content of the video,

are you kidding
the only way to do a good behind the scenes video is to actually show what's in the video





step 




approach it again 





so really then


how the F will this ever work



back to trying to just keep doing 7 vines and do the long ones at the same time

i am still assuming it's possible but i have a ways to go



so where does that leave us with tues?  and are we still obliterating the schedule$%$%$%$%$%vid

behind the scenes

desk cam... kind of dazed and confused

how can i make long videos ...
if i have to make 7 vines a week?




still can't think of a good setup




gonna make a longer video I don't care if it takes forever


that's srsly the best  setup  I can think of


srsly  there's no where else to go for me without experimenting with longer videos





how to make a video longer than 6 and a half seconds



I still like the idea of somehow  announcing it first   even though I still can't find the wording$%$%$%$%$%vid experiment 

for fucksake you have to try drawing vids just to get the technique$%$%$%$%$%note

write from  tweets


melody from speech



anagrams



journal videos (from text journal.  with setup and title . and any other help u can get)




behind the scenes 
even that has way too many categories 


journal


but tbh  what can I even fit in a vine




but Tuesday is currently without a format so I have to figure out something to fit there






anagrams genre is vine able

i know you feel like you're in a rut on monday videos, but remember you're free

just think back to why you first created the genre 

free vids   completely new content    non-camera.   I really never specified whether narration is allowed did i.   it's honestly better when i use it.  so what does that mean. is it allowed now

I really mega need a transformation here



maybe even ditch that spelling video. I mean, if so you can use it next week

this meant to be the most free & mind blowing experience of your life. so come on, get with it



seriously I wonder what the next Monday idea is gonna be 



I mean srsly this is when u can really open it up$%$%$%$%$%knock knock
who are you$%$%$%$%$%format

here's an idea:
with regard to easing into the length regulation system.

how bout for the other 2 days (tue and wed)  you could consider that you are already part of the quota system, but to make it easier, have it be the same total length, but over 4 and 5 weeks instead of 3, right?
just the ease into it. so that gives you the opportunity to get ahead, but you're also not damaging yourself if you chicken out and micro.$%$%$%$%$%I'm in love with colors$%$%$%$%$%i just realized that my downfall for my entire life has been not being able to be everywhere at once, physically$%$%$%$%$%note

so hey, that's not too hard to do.

think about it. 
length regulations are the thing that is really separating you from the real content creators.


imagine if u had length regulations--- for even Monday!!!

you would be forced to actually write something! with meaning! about a topic!!

I think it is possible to figure this out.

hi

it's whatever

I'm whatever



how am I gonna post stuff and what kind

what do you think

I need to go to square one and have a zen moment, right?






ok, just want to post and make crazy content, and get crazy, ok?

getting there


again not sure what I should do

you need to get super clear and free, which I think I will do when I get home


I'm just not sure, but I want things to be clear and simple, and also, i DO want to make new content.

keep posting notes. I think that's real..... super real, what do you think?

and recording songs, for sure , hell yea, hella!

and making music videos too is fine, whatever. what do you think? I think you have to choose them right, what do you think, right?

oh wow.   making music videos is going to be a great excuse to make content, right?     

what about text videos???

how you going to get to this?

you really have to do it from notes, don't you.

yes and no. that would surely create a date crisis







fuck sake why can't you make weekly videos

don't worry there will be at least notes on the reg.


and pictures.

come on , you can get this.

what else is laying around in visual queue??

really ought to do the rome/christianity acquisition


really ought to work with project sort.

srsly.   there is mad bad stuff to do.

but if you are dealing with improv sessions, then you're going to need to get a sense of completeness and thus a good starting point.

eek

can't wait to get home but i need to sleep

look at project sort

srsly, I think you got everything you need in there

and if not then put more things in there.   huh? can I get it? wtf, can u always be working?   what about going thru improv archives in a less random manner?

I would appreciate that.



what do u think


jeez I want to get this so bad I could buy a new pony or camel$%$%$%$%$%hi there

hi

good morning

I'm in space

I just woke up 


I anticipate getting home so i can do more work.
that's about it, seriously, there's nothing else to this 
seriously very excited about posting content.  it's crazy.
in the process of posting individual songs.
does that make sense....
note taker should go up soon, what do you think.
holy crap, this is going to be great, im going to post everything!$%$%$%$%$%note

hi, good morning


I have a website

I think I will post my life on it

seriously, it will make me feel better$%$%$%$%$%note to self

you should also download every song ever before it becomes completely impossible$%$%$%$%$%hi

i'm cool

whatever

bye$%$%$%$%$%note


free falling into the future.
the only thing I can do to remedy this is accelerate song recording.$%$%$%$%$%note


convinced that I'm going to get a daily post schedule going.

can you post 1 movie a day? maybe? maybe.  
let me think about this.  can you move one thing along from each department per day?
I dunno.
you have to move one thing per day.
how bout that.
no, still doesn't quite make sense. 

what about dropping a finished product?
ie scoring something from scoring cue??? 

getting warmer.

jus looking for a foolproof system here.

what of longer products?

how and when can I choose to work on them, how much, and which ones?? ie how long?


what is the story really???

pictures are whatever, they are easy.

the longer the piece, the more  carefully you have to choose it.

so how can we deal with that flexible multidimensionality?

 I like the idea of regular releases.

but I haven't yet grasped the flexibity of the diff lengths of content you could choose from.

what's to keep you from slipping into always doing easy pictures?






there's got to be a simple solution to this.


I feel like I'm trying to solve a rainbow






thing is, I wish you could just say to do 1 thing per x amount of time,
but the problem is, the size is the projects are too variable.$%$%$%$%$%note

and did you realize , optimism is contagious$%$%$%$%$%note

I thought of an idea for what you could do over the next 10 years....

go bananas$%$%$%$%$%to do list

a good way to deal with this stuff that you may have forgotten about is

i have a thing of things on my thinglet .    we are thingin  unbelievably hard core,  this time .
GO THING A THING

it means, go take everything youve ever did // built , and put it together and make it great .

But  why ,  and when ,   they/she/we questioned ?


nowhere and i dont care this thing is getting too hard and exhausting, cauze who cares about this page anyway, not me .

fuck it,  and you



GO FLY A KYTE AND CLIMB IT$%$%$%$%$%Sunday, May 22, 2011 6:46:54 PM


hrgfydhrsmrrenslckd.  Ok .


just to review.

i wrote in my journals the last 2 days, with specifically the result of getting heavy on the issues .


the questions was ; 

let's see if questions still remain 




What questions ,  who's asking 



is there anxiousness . 

well, partially no, because you know what to do now . 

you know who you are, and what kind of strength you can incur .


You are your own person, and thus  are   Free .

and therefore, you can also make use  of    existentially free  mediums    in the way that you want to 


but the difference is now that you have graduated from insecure school, you have a responsibility to breathe and feel love for sure and certain .  do you know what this means yet, i'm not sure you do . 

you'll have to walk around and/or stay home until you figure it out .
it takes time 

it's real, 
it's you
if you're not used to doing this, i can't see how you would be

YOU ARE FREE

and yes, you know how to use these mediums,  but you had not previously had all your eggs in this basket .

you have now recovered all your eggs ,     so    place them in the basket    now         ..     ok ,  please .


here  they  go    [[ eggs  ,   dropping  in  to  the  basket  ]]



The basket   consists  of    all that you have time to do ,  all creative medium which you have time and scheduling  sovereignty   over      



So there it is .


there is no more   not having eggs  in the basket .


you have actually done pretty fantastically impressive things in these mediums, in a free and creative manner,  with basically no eggs .


but now ther's eggs.

ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ whatthefuck
hello my name is bill i'm from earth .
i    don't play the tuba

hold on, i'm thinking of real things to say or not say .

ok


HONESTY     EVENT     BARRIER



fuck it, i really want to communicate  with                                                 you

who

not me

you


who


not
me


us


you


yourself



am i / is this insane?






no /sure .


ok, now let's get into this . it's 2049 .



think . and.  talk .


we've talked about this before .

this is the juncture of your higherself .   we've (i've) gave you advice on this before .


breathing is essential .  you're doing that ,  you're still doing it .  you've been doing that for quite some time now .


every instrument you've played has been the correct one .


you have expressed to me that you are wondering  EXACTLY   and specifically what to do     even   next .

in this late  20  11111  stage    in things .. these games   .



and i know  //  don't know what to tell you .



you have expressed interest   in               knowing      what to do , and how to do exactly the right thing .




you have already done many many many many  of the right things .

so what's your question ?


your question to me is   "are we,  is this     are we on the right track"


and you want me to answer you .


cuz  yes,  no,  if you stopped, today,   no   , i suppose then you'd be in a slump .  but the trigger (tric)   is  is that you can always  and still are   realizeing  new stuff .   all the time, every day ,  new lists of brand new false  (fantastic )   trigger  (fingered)  stuff,  all  straight from the brain ,  dome(s)   to be (well)  realized  .  
((seize the day /s ..////  efforts ))


OK ??


is that what you are talking //   warning me about ?


Okay , then .   looks pondiferous .


so ,  to grasp  (to escape)   new meaning ,      
we are collectively   reqesting //  asking   your permission  //  advice       

on the subject of  how   EXACTLY  to make up the   agenda  list    


because                              you have   stated  and dilligently  requested       that your overall agenda 
in the grand scheme of things   is overwhelmingly fine, and correct .  Is this true, and can it be true,

and well, no and yes, cause you can forget .


and as you can see we understand this .  (i / you's  being switched, etc.)



so  try  and help  us    be  started                   learn   //    be true       to myself     ourselves 


get truth      (let)s    ( )    through      .............................................................................................

OK .   so     






so what the hell were we all asking ourselves here ?


DAMMIT    

there is frustration here, and it hits a wall of frustration .  that couldn't be good .



fuck it,  fax me some new memos .   ___________   i want to  see thru  the telescope  at something that is near, new, and blinding .


But  WHY ?


and do you think you are ready ?


Yes,    and,       i think i'm ready .


well,  fine             .. come near me   they said 


who sai d?


gather round,  we all said .


(What are they going to say ?)    we all wondered


nobody's going anywhere, saying anything . she indicated

we're all (self) included in this .



go somewhere  you feel comfortable (and/or)  familiar .  that's the only way  to  get //come  control  of this .


looks tired / and familiar  , i know is what youre thinking .
tired and familiar
tired and familiar
tired and familiar


so,  fine , ?   go the long way  .    ??

Well it seems you shouldn't have to ,  is what i've always said .


(who or me, now   ?    etc  mixups are getting backwards)


Ok, well, everybody's tired here, and i honestly don't know who's asking what .
so you'll have to try and be more familiar and speak in sense tones // in line // with what you're familiar with .

i don't really see/ understand the problem  with   waiting   until youre read y   for something  to do it .

because  You Have  to  do something you're REady  For .


so if you're come crying to me // complaining  that   "I'M NOT READY FOR ANYTHING"
then i don't really know what to help you with . 

cuz you have to be ready for something .


ok then, that's good .  so 
i guess
then

it should be itterated

you asking "what am i ready for "

well, sure that's reasonable .  


i think you're ready to count and play crazy games with time, are you not


that is suggestible



you always get hung up on this relevance //belief  to other people .
or, no, to rephrase that ,  the reverse is true, in fact .

so anyway, i understand very well your concerns, strenghts, anxiousnesses, and anxieties .

so let's all get together and think about this one .


i have faith // no doubts  that you all are in this for the right reasons .

no ones doubting that ,  the thing is,  the one who always has the hardest time remembering this is you .


so if you're stressing about what not or what to do at any particular time, my advice would be   is   to 



Take  a   walk   out  and   enjoy  the sunshine . 

take it in , while you can or can't .  there still is time .


So,   and let me try and understand your concerns a little better .


When you take a walk in the sunshine, and then come back, everything is the same, yes ?  and the problem is that everything all still seems so separated .  is that it ?


a ha .     touching isnt it , how we can't live apart ?  damwell for sure i'll be sarcastic .

we have to be a little more sure that something is controlling each one of us at the same time, and thatwhich is the same thing that controls the sun .

Does that make sense , ?  there,  i just said it for you .    now is that going to make you   able  to get it ?


.......... hold on, i'm thinking .  you're // we're  getting this    she    they   all said to each other .


now how can we do this ?  i mean, here, this is it, we can't  you can't  it can't be denied ,  surely this is it , they all said // tried to say .


so omg what next, is what one of them all started saying .


This  time ,  we're sure of it ,  they all said aloud,   certainly .






Ok,  so now,  i'm stuck here dealing with YOU .  now what is it that YOU   need to know, still ?

damn, boy, you are stuck on this tired thing . man, give me a break.  buy a more energetic bracelet  or something . put wings on it .

do as your thing (d) .


ok fine, what do you want me to say ?   you've said (// done it all before . just fuckin  

go back and remember it .


you're wearing the same sneakers as you were then ,   fuck it .



are you seriously asking me to remember this for you ?


god dam it ,   who kidding .



do you think you're getting scared now to have time 


do you think now you're getting scared   Now      just so you'll have more time 


and hiding from the fact that merely just upon youre scaredcity  alone  that you 'd  request for more time, and thus you are not letting yourself get to the bottom of this .

you have all you own darned notebooks in your posession .   you have what it means to take care of this , you're just not doing it ,  so  

don't look at me 



your wings  are   just     dried // busted .   


you'll just have to have them  re  adjusted //wettened      fixed    renewed .   



Ok,   i think i can see what's going on now  .    i think you might be actually a little scared at how readily available this thing is  to all work out ,   in these days .

is that is ? 

cuz  that's it ,  i'm pretty sure  (i think )


so now , gee willikers ,   what are we going to do  


ok you're asking me what to do again , and i can't really figure it out, because i am not a person capable of thinking on my own .



ok, let me try and see 











you are good .   everything looks really good from what i can see , everything looks always and overwhelmingly clear to me .  
i'm really tired and sick of saying this to me .

it's like there's a million phone booths  all standing next to each other, and they all have a perfectly well diligent directory in them .  and now you're standing here and you don't know what to do with them. 


i think i see the problem .

tell me if i am seeing correctly .    you have all the answers layed out for you, in multiple choices .  but you feel as though you have to be creative in any choice you make .  is that what this is , , ?? 


ok, yes, that is what it is ,  i'm quite certain ,  almost  thinking .


so what's the solution then, is what you are asking me, or is what your agents are asking me .


and, now, i'm just guessing, brainwashing here ,so dont take this too literally right off the bat, but my one suggestion (and it's just a suggestion, i don't mean to sound serious)   is     to   don't do anything .

and they will come for you etc it will happen all by itself .

Now,  but i'm not sure that's true .  don't let me quote you on that, because i really don't fully believe and/or feel that is the case, you know why, because that does not involve you couraging up a solution to anything .
so that being lit, i'm in fact sure that answer is no good .

so where were we, anyways, oh ya, i was thinking .  

what are some ways you could make fruitful and creative decisions without feeling creative .

right ?  is that it ?

no, they all said .  yes, and i'm sure, they all notconfusedly  acqlaimed  at once .

VERY TIREDING  this has all been said .


OKAY,   we get it !   it was all coming in clearer now,  again ,  once more .


OKAY

the group said .   it was saying,  when it actually talks as a whole, everybody listens somehow .




this is ouch madness right here .

i'm telling you,  i'm saying, and i'm agreeing with myself here, this is damn ouch march madness .


you are silly 
you are silly
you are silly
you are silly
you are silly

there is no more asking and answering, i know longer feel like you are answering to me any more .


so we'll have to wait until another time to do this more thoroughly.




ok, so what are you saying .  youre saying  that .....   you are hopelessly lost and confused ? with regard to what to do ?

because  you are willing to do whatever ,    and so therefore you can't figure out what to do

and you're trying to figure out how to feel "inspired" about something


and you're waiting 10s of thousands of years before you discover all of the correct answers which are in your notebooks ,   is that correct?


is that correct ?


am i correc t?


whoa , ok, you just saw it ,  a lot of of it ,  if i'm correct // ly mistaken ..

hmmm.

so , now, what's going on , are you just afraid to admit it ?

i think yes you are
aren't you


Well 



YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER EVERYBODY ELSE IN THIS

i think i know that .



he is saying that
i am saying this
you are saying that


of course, duh 

who's talking now 


shit 

















ok

ok 
ok
ok
ok
ok
ok
ok
ok
ok
ok
ok
ok
ok
ok 
what a silly thing this little thing is .
it's like we've been trying to get over the mexican bridge .



i want to know
whatmore to do on this 
tomorrow or today .
or any day .

how am i supposed to know  what  to do  when  on which day .   i am capable of anything ,   he/she was saying .

ok good, we know this, we have established this .

i think you two are meant for each other .

fuck it i dunno who said that, it wasnt us .

dam it.

this is fucked, 

this whole thing is fuckin fucked. who are you . this whole damn thing is fucked to pieces, you know that .

i'm nost sure whos talking, and neither should you be .  its all non e of its in english .
MONDAY
TUESDAY
WEDNESDAY
THURSDAY
FRIDAY
SATURDAY
SUNDAY




ok, so the issue now is ,  you think you have figured out that the issue is that you have a billion choices but you insist on being creative at every step of theway.  and youd surely like to know that you can't apologize for that.  you can't seem to find any way out of it  , and you probably don't want to.

SO THAT'S JUST IT  you insist on feeling creative .


you already wrote the book on being creative . that's the part that should be ironic to you .  is you have all your own materials to instruct you how to do this .   but i think you are scared .

yes//no//whatis this .  I know .

the question is, when climbing the higher mointain,  Who' s  the product ?

i see . because when you climb mountains this high, the product is certainly a who, not it .



I get it now,  i think , at least .       




so  you're wondering again,  what you should do , and what your agenda  should be .



and i understand and yet don't understand your concerns. 


because whatever you did, whatever you plan on doing, you'll need to do it yourself .  you'll HAD  to've  have'd  to  need   (d)    to  do it / have done it yourself , because it is YOUR self ,  it is YOUR stuff, and it belongs to you .  you created it ,  you invented it , you needed it . 

You'll have to come invent it ,   Just  the way you invented all that other stuff, before .



ALL your old freedom // creativity stuff .  you invented it .  from the start .     

Why  ?   How ?   i dunno , but you did it, somehow .


So it looks // seems as though you would have every right to do the same thing now, am i not mistaken ?


try and think with me on this .


Is that what we're getting at ?


OKAY  so now, fuck it , what do you want ?

who the hell are you anyway, and what do you want ?



Start by telling me some basic issues here .

tell yourself that though, not me, cuz fuck it ,who am i, i am just the page talking to yourself. 




TELL ME  WHO   YOU WISH   TO ACHEIVE 


well fuck it ,   that's a silly comment, cuz we both know all of us know already .


so let's stop holding each other hostage here .  but you have to realize that you have seen it , you have to have seen it ,  but we just  have to go over it again .

you have to go over this again .   if you care . right

yes that's what i said .

thank you
thank you
no thank you thank you 
no thank you 
no thank you

doesn't seem possible.  if i work  4 full days a week... which is by all means possible.  ....  i'd have 24 working days until my target.  ....

but guess what buster, time is limited and you need to at least prioritize.
 
cuz, sure, too, time is infinite, but its allso limited within itself so u better straighten your priorities or your pants will certainly never look apropriate.
 
why do you think these rhythms prioritize themselves?  why do you suppose all these tunes arent filled with CONSTANT SINGLETONE MONOTONE NOPATTERN NORESONANCE DEADTONE?
 
because this is URGENT  and we cant keep the mono tone  monotoning.

Well hi. 
So here's the situation, really.
Early November I started experimenting with videos, text that types itself, and then putting music along to it. On nov 8 I went to see the late show with david letterman, which in reality is not all that late.  Then when I returned home, I was inspired to clean up my room and turn it into a television studio.$%$%$%$%$%Tuesday, November 9, 2010 1:15:36 PM
 
 
had a very valuable dream this morning.  hmm.  a very valuable dream.
 
i was having a conversation.... explaining how i really don't want to be stuck in a boring reality that   ..  well ..    most people are actually stuck in.    it had a lot of strong feelings attatched to it.  i was saying   'do you seriously think i would be happy .. just ... i dunno , .. working at dominos , .. you know, .. driving home from work from domino's, ... listening to ....... U2   ... and  you know ...  thinking that's all there is to reality??  and poluting up the environment with my car ?????
 
what i was saying was , ... is anybody really happy just thinking that's all there is to reality?
 
 
and then ... when i woke up, it left me really wondering if that was all there is.   well, .... of course i know it's not, but it really left me a bit scared for a minute, thinking holy shit, that would be scary ...... 
 
and it really made me wonder ... again ..... what the hell is up with this world?
 
 
it's like if you took the numbers 1 and 2,  which ... know ... they're supposed to be together, ... and then gave them birth in seperate universes from one and other, and said "here, you figure out what happened".  "you figure out where you are."   "you figure out what's going on"
 
cause there is a trick to this.   there IS something that's going on.   it's not just some random hell.   Hell, i'm smart enough to know that.   here it is, this is the big one.   Try me.$%$%$%$%$%Waiting for train.

I am me

But whatever



So I was working with garage band, and dammit my songs are getting too complex to be processed easily by the GarageBand.  I don't know what to do. This track eatbread/feelsure is taking ridiculously long, and it is mainly because it takes like 8 bars to stop the thing after I hit stop, and it most of the time won't even play.
I tried exporting the 1sr half of the song and doing it in 2 layers, and I got almost to the end, but still, both halves individually are totally maxed out, and can't handle any more shit. And I can't listen to them anymore without the thing stopping.  what really fucked with my brain is that the help page (which of course has been copied verbatim all over the Internet by extremely helpful people) suggests... Among other things... To convert software instruments to real instruments.. i. e. Midi to audio.  Now there's a good idea, however... It's actually not possible to do that on garage band. I think it's a poorly written help thing which meant to say they are talking about loops, which I don't use. When using loops it's possible to do that stuff. But that one sentence in the help file made it sound possible to convert midi regions to audio regions. not possible. So now I have to think about how on earth I'm going to get this happening, cause I got to create shit with much more fervor.

How about locking tracks, yes I believe that may be the next step.$%$%$%$%$%I am here, it is time to entertain myself again, all the way up the block.  My train is arriving at 4 av. 
I am switching to like n or r or something.
This room is silent. Garbage juice drips from the ceiling ambiently.
Ok so what was that shit?  9485. 1897.  This contains 7. 271.  Done.  Official answer is 5, 7, 271.


I don't know if I ever really finished discussing techniques for doing this. I never talked about going from the left. This is often much quicker.   Extremely quick.  Here comes the train, we'll work with the number of the train. Nevermind, it went by.  

Ok I'm on the train.  Here's my number. 5491.  3 is out. for 7,  I see 91. But 54 is not, so 7 is out.  checking 11, I will go from the right.  548, plus 22 is 570. 11 out.  13 again ruled out based on 91.  17.  To work from the left, we look at the 54, and then compare it to the next lowest multiple of 17, which is 51.  We replace it with the difference. We repace 54 with 3, to get 391. We can go from either side. From the right, we could subtract 51 to get 34 (bingo) or from the left we could subtract 340 and get 51.  So now we have to retrace our steps. We know we have found 17 in the original number, but times what?  When retracing my steps, I like to redo the calculation from the right side. 5491 minus 51 is 544. Minus 34 is 510. So 510 is 17 times 30, plus the 34 meAns an extra 2. So 32 means 320, plus the extra 3 for the 51.  323.  I also happen to know that 323 is something.... What was it... Ah yes, 17.  I just found that by Adding 17 to it and getting 340. So one less than 20 is 19. So 17 x 17 x 19  = 5491.  That was a tasty one.$%$%$%$%$%I just typed something of a lesson on number factorization . It was wonderful. It makes me want to eat pumpkin pie all the time. 
I think I'll wake up in Brooklyn tomorrow.$%$%$%$%$%So I was going to talk about how to factor numbers.

Let's try a zip code such as 27036. I don't know where that is, but let's try it.
It's clearly got 3 in it, and the digit adding principle is actually exclusive to 9 as well, so we can very quickly extract 9 from this to get 3004.
still is even.  Still 4, in fact.  cut it in half is 1502, and again is 751.  it's odd, and has no 3 in it.  so now, we begin checking every other potential prime factor in order starting with 7, 11, 13, 17, etc

So were working on 751, checking systematically, starting with 7.

basically the concept is to modify your large number by addition or subtraction of the factor you're checking for until you reach or do not reach a recognizable form of that factor. 
So in this case we add or subtract multiples of seven from 751 until we see something recognizable as either a multiple of 7, or not.  You can work from the right or the left, or occasionally the middle, whichever is easier. Here it seems easiest to work from the left. You can obliterate the digit 7, and you're left with 51. If you are familiar with 51 as being simply 17 times 3, we are ready in recognizable territory. Thus 7 is out.  This also knocks out 17, for those of you who can actually remember that by the time you get around to checking 17.

11

Working from the right is, I feel, sort ofthe bread and butter technique. The strategy is to turn the last digit into a zero so you can delete it.  we'll subtract 11. = 740, so now we can just deal with 74, and 74 clearly is no multiple of 11.

13

In order to work fromthe right, adding or subtracting 13 won't help us turn 751 into a multiple of 10.  but we can use  another multiple of 13 such as 39 or 91.  I prefer 39.  Add 39, and it's 790, which translates to 79.  Your local multiple of 13 in the seventies is 78, so 13 is ruled out.

17... We know 17 is out, cause if you eliminate the 51, you're left with 7.  if part of a number looks like a multiple of 17, (or anything) the rest of it has to look like a multiple of 17 also in order for the whole thing to be a multiple of 17.  So 751 does not have 17 in it, but 1751, 3451, and 5151 all do.

checking now for 19.
Easy enough, we add 19. = 770. 
clearly no 19.  In fact, when you do one step of addition and arrive at something ELSE recognizable other than, in this case, 19, you can rule out both, however in this case we already checked the other one so it's already known.  In other words, when we added 19 and got 770, we are also ruling out 11.... But we had already ruled out 11 anyway. 

23 now we get into the territory of special tricks.  

Typically, when dealing with primes 7 up to 19, you can always work with either the number itself or triple the number in order to get it to match up to the tens place.  In otherwords, once I've got a large number cleared out of all 3s and 2s and 5s, it always ends with either a 1, 3, 7, or 9. There's no other way.  And any potential prime factor canidate from 7 and up also ends with 1, 3, 7, or 9.  Which means that it is always either 1 or 3 away from a multiple of ten. So that means you can always get to a multiple of 10 by either adding or subtracting the potential factor or it's triple.  You'll see what I mean when we do more exAmples. 
But I find that when you get up to 23, or sometimes even before then, it pushes you over the hundred boundary, and the computation becomes no fun.... So I have some interesting alternatives, which get most frequently used starting with 23.  

Basic prActice would be to use 69 as your basic alternate for 23 in order to add it to 751.... But that pushes us over the hundred line and it's kind if a headache.  So Ive some secret special trick alternates.   My special alternate for 23 is 299. 299 is some multiple of 23, and I haven't memorized which one it is, but I can always figure it out on case it makes a hit.

The purpose of these special tricks is usually to be within 1 or 3 of 100.

So, to use that one in this situation-- 751 + 299 = 1050, therefore 105.  105 is commonly known to me as 7 x 15, so 23 is out.

29, my special trick is 203, but I don't need it becaus 29 is ready in the right form.  As long as were working with 751, and if were working from the right, were going to need numbers that are 1 away from the nearest 10. So 751+29= 78, that is a 13 multiple so 29 is gone.

Next... Is 31.  Easy. Subtract 31, you get 720 or 72. We all k kow that 72 is made up of nothing but 2s and 3s, so forget it.

37... For this we would need a trick. 37 is one of my favorite numbers because 37 x 3 is 111.  This comes in very handy.  It doesn't follow the formula of directly hugging the nearest hundred, but it is close enought and easy in it's own way to compute.   751 - 111 is 640 or 64.  not 37, not 74.  37 is out.   
BY THE WAY,  we've actually just wasted a lot of time, because as long as you sufficiently check every increasing prime number, you can actually stop once you reach the square root of the target number.   That's why it's good to know your squares of little primes. For example.... 29 squared is 841... so that means... If were checking 751 to find what's in it, and we've checked everything up until 23, then we don't need to check anything higher. cause, ok, what if we checked 29... And found it... It's like, 29 times what??? Nothing, cause we already ruled out anything less. Factors come in partners, and we already ruled out every other partner, so once your checkers are bigger than your target when you square them, then you can quit. As long as you were thorough up to that point.   So we have proved that 751 is prime.... So now we just have to retrace our steps.   751x2x2x3x3=27036.$%$%$%$%$%Brooklyn is large, and I flow through it like lemon juice, making what I can out of every possible situation.$%$%$%$%$%Life is a funny strange and interesting thing.  

I am sitting here enjoying myself on my iPhone as usual, in fact I am at my friend jon's house, texting with fervor on my iPhone.  
Tomorrow I will rent a cow from the marketplace. 

Hahaha  dont have a cow. I am a cow.


There is no telling what may happen once things start happening.$%$%$%$%$%I'm sitting inside a bar in northern park slope Brooklyn. It is somewhat of a tea bar. There is music playing, blahblah blah, 
I am sitting on a very nice and comfortable couch, seemingly free of charge. I have my iPhone out and I'm texting.
I'm here with my friend jon V, he's outside communicating with his girlfriend. There's a sort of Erika Badu sounding song playing. It is Saturday night, roughly.  I'm taming my gremlin.
I'm breathing..... There's a lot of good stuff to breathe about.
I think I'm about to go apeshit with the text. 
HahahahahahahHHHHHahahahahahahaha
I own a small island.
I have a house, and in that house there are lots of servants.

Anyway, I'm talking about etheral things, but I should stop.


Brooklyn exists, and I am in it.

They say I'll have to pay the rent sometime soon. 

I'm not sure what that means for me and my family. 


They say I should rent a studio and start using it.

They say I should hire a band and start playing with it. 

They say I should collect a paycheck.

They say I should hire a clown and start being him.

Thy say I should collect insurance on my fallbacks and drawbacks.

They say I should buy a hyper pipe and wear it.
They say I should ride in a hyper balloon kite every day.
They say I am not man or mammal enough

I'm beginning to become uncomfortable sitting in this unusual location. 

Jon's still on the phone with his girlfriend. Whatever.
I still don't have an understanding of exactly why I am in here.  
I find it quite remarkable that I am able to generate words one after another out of nowhere, and keep constantly putting them on the piece of paper on front of me.

Aahh, it feels like I have a library card that's gonna keep expiring for the next 10 years. 
it's like I am a record keeper, but I've come across an Indian giver. 
it's like my mammy is dressed in marmalade.

It's like I have nowhere of getting then to here.

It's like I have no yen to get. Only to give. 


It's like I have no ferry ride left to pay.

It's as if there is no more then and there, and if and only are the same thing.


It's like I am a wandering watering can.











i haven't chosen a universe.. To fit into.
It's interesting, I'm thinking of this as we're listening to 'the love below' record that Andre 3000 put out in 2003. 

This is a fantastic record, they're letting it play. It seems to be shuffling both sides.  


So, in conclusion, bunny rabbits have both heads and tails, and also I'm excited about the coming elections in 2012, as well as the coming winter olympics in 2012, and also the coming end of the world in 2011.$%$%$%$%$%I just have to quit thinking that im going to do ANYTHING 'normal' or anything that would fit right in to today's reality.$%$%$%$%$%Typing is a very fun and enjoyable thing to do and I really like to do it very very much.

'we all know what it is'  they echoed
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
there it was.
 
 
 
 
 
 
they all knew they'd know it when they'd seen it
 
the trouble was just getting around to throwing it there, holding up the meaning, &
 
being there
 
 
when it matters most .
 
 
when does it matter most?
 
 
'it matters most in the eveningtime,  in the morning ,  and 2 or 3 other times throughout the day' he said i guess
 
 
 
 
then when is it not trivial ?
 
 
 
 
 
now or never
 
 
 
 
 
when is the world made of plastic ?

Look at your watch or time piece.  Once you figure out what it says, you may begin to tell time.

Hire a baby to sell tires for you.  Then you will realize that you are part of both a michelin commercial and a zen diagram.  A zen diagram, by the way, is a poem about babies and tires that doesn't make any sense, and is designed to get you hooked on nonsense.  It worked for michelin, they sell lots of tires, and it also worked for zen books, they sell lots of nonsense.$%$%$%$%$%I am a bobblehead garbage pale.  I represent the coach of the brooklyn garbageball team.  I resent being fired, and i resent my team losing the big game to the westland eastsiders.  I resent my mother, i resent my family, i resent my name, but most of all, i resent the westland eastsiders.$%$%$%$%$%Phelix the cat had no ancestors.

Damn it takes a long time for this train to get home.  I have so much time on my hands i have decided to write prose.
Prose by the way is when you write something on paper and it either makes sense or doesn't make sense.  It's great, it's like driving a car and then realizing that you ended up in a different place from when you started, and that's how you know the car works.$%$%$%$%$%Train prose. 
I'm at 59th street.  This is a manhattan based Q train.  This is a queens based operating system.  I am a cube based heat machine devouring a liquid blanket.  By the way did you know a cube is a vine, check your blackberry.  It's truue.  YOU ARE IMPORTANT.j$%$%$%$%$%about songwriting
 
Doing this is like growing a baby out of steel.  It will whine and complain at you every step of the way for you to make the wildest twists and turns, even unexpected things, like perform voodoo and catch the thing on fire.  Knowing that, true, if you were to just make it some arms and legs into the shape of a baby, it wouldn't be worth anything but a lousy chunk of steel, and wouldn't breathe an ounce worth of life.  The baby knows what you are not to do, only time will tell by it correcting your mistakes if you are able to learn the honed craft of making a baby.$%$%$%$%$%how i long to live forever even around like 9 oclock .$%$%$%$%$%let's see .

i came in,  and i examined the flow of time,   as i stood up,   with my jacket.   at every moment and second.  i whatever.  i guess i was at a moment when i could come to terms with my past, somehow, or something,   and i was playing with my jacket,  or whatever.  and stuff.  and things.   etc.    i realized,   discovered that that was important.    i realized,  discovered the main important difference of a room in motion thru time.   of a .    room in motion thru time.

and the keyboard then played a role in it.


i realized  --- 1.  cut it short, for entertaining purposes

2.  just learn the keyboard in itself

there has been a cloak.     it has cloaked everything about the situation and made everything all confusing.     other things were confusing too.


the rain re-discovered itself as we drove down to southern north carolina.   they all traded spots and no one could hear each other.     the jets poured on mercilessly.    they sat,  all looking at each other, hopelessly, in silence,  not knowing what to do with one another.   

this is it

they drove up the coast not knowing where to go or who was looking.   

they all sat in silence,  and remembered themselves.


it became rainy.


there became breakfast.

Their ears re adjusted to the sound of the heat, and the places where they were sitting re-convulsed.


THE EARS WIGGLED ON,  SHAMELESSLY


their clever musings followed.



The whole room was a bucket filled with silence.                   



then the bottom fell out................    it was over.   music blared.          


Puppets.



all we could see was puppets.



kind of like how they're together, flying on a rock.




i can't help but notice that this story takes place 8 thousand years ago.   woulndt you rather take part in a story that is happening now?     etc


i've always thought that would be more interesting.    so i think i'm going to try to bring it to life.      


blah blah blah   see my new film movie its in stores and theatres next week



blah blah blah blah etc, i'm probably crazy.        etc, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc, i am lying down.     the thing is, cause, see

what do people do when they're bored?



You are never allowed to be bored.                           (exactly)







it's like everything.   practice makes u get better.  and i want to get better.   it's one of those things, where it's like plants and they inhabit themselves.$%$%$%$%$%making cartoons is not right for me.

it's the i dunno.   but it is what it is.   it's the huh.




it's the 3 carrot shock.







etc.   if i'm anyone, i'll do something.














blah blah 





now the next question is drums sequencing



and the next question after that is writing ordering.




cause i can write whatever i want, and who knows why  ??  ¿?¿?¿?













the point is,  i'm not thinking clearly enough about my whole situation .        




the point is,  there's a million questions that could be posed
